Pico-8 RPG Game. It's Mostly a Prototype. 
--------------------


In it, you play a character who falls into a mysterious underworld, and in order to get out, you must revive a sleeping princesss y collecting 4 magic orbs. 
In the game you explore the world talking to strange characters, and collect items. 

As you move your sanity slowly drops, and when they hit low enough, certain enemies spawn. 

Also along the way there are traps which drop your hp. when it hits zero, its game over.
Keys will open doors, and swords will kill zombies that might get in the way.
Pills, and berries will lower sanity.
Money doesn't work yet, but it will be used for shops and inns (TBD). 


---------------
This is a Pico 8 game.
To play the game, you can either get the pico8 app, and load the P8 file, Or use the exported apps in the folder. 


Up, Down, Left, Right; move


--------
The game is a prototype, and has some WIP elements to work out. 
I intend to expand the adventure elements and use its base engine for a future Dragon Quest style RPG.

This game was originally created for a game jam, that I later expanded into something more complete.
